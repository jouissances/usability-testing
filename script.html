        <div class="quote">
            <p>"Hi. My name is Janice, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that we’re working on so we can see whether it works as intended.
            The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. There is no right or wrong answer.</p>
            <p>As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us. Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know. </p>
            <p>OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions. First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day? Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether would you say you spend browsing the Internet?</p>
            <p>What kinds of sites are you looking at when you browse the Web? Do you have any favorite websites?" </p>

            <p>OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things. </p>
            <p>Now I’m going to ask you to try doing some specific tasks. I’m going to read each one out loud and give you a printed copy. And again, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try to think out loud as you go along.</p>

            <h2>Observations</h2>
                <div class="results">
                    <h3>Upload a photo</h3>
                        <p><span class="yellow">First screen</span>: User clicked on the Camera icon at the upper-left corner, then expected to reach the second screen, which is not the case — the Camera icon leads to a real-time camera feature, where users capture an image via the Instagram app and posts that image. To access the Photo Album as shown in the second screen, the user needed to click on the Plus icon at the bottom-center of the screen.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Second screen</span>: Afterwards, the user chose a photo by clicking on one of the small squares within the lower half of the screen. However, user didn’t click Next — he expected to reach the third screen right away.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Third screen</span>: User didn’t use the in-app filter features, as they are ‘for peasants’. User clicked Next.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Fourth screen</span>: User clicked on the caption section, and typed in some caption (“Me and my girlfriend, hashtag”). User commented that he would mostly post fitness pictures, and would leave the app to do a Google search on the current top fitness hashtags, copy them, then come back to the app and paste them in. User doesn’t usually use the tag or location feature. If user thinks that the pictures are good enough, he will opt to share the photo on Facebook. Not Twitter or Tumblr, as user does not have active accounts.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Fifth screen</span>: Task is done.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Comment on a photo</h3>
                        <p><span class="yellow">First screen</span>: User clicked on the Speech Bubble icon under the Instagram picture post. There is another alternative way to add comment, via the ‘Add a comment…’ section, however, user chose the first method.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Second screen</span>: User types his comment (“Yoooooo”). User expected to click an Enter key on the keyboard to post, however, finds none, and finally clicked on the Post section after a couple of tries. Task is done.</p>

                    <div class="photos">

                    <h3>Create an Instagram story</h3>
                        <p><span class="yellow">First screen</span>: User clicked on the You icon.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Second and third screen</span>: User clicked and held on the bottom-center round button while panning the paper. User clicked the right arrow at the upper-right corner.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Fourth screen</span>: User added a gif sticker (“Dancing Shaq”) and clicks the Your Story icon at the bottom-left corner. Task is done.</p>
                        <p><span class="yellow">Fifth screen</span>: Does not apply to user, as this screen only appears when user clicks on the Send To icon at the bottom-right corner.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>Alright. Do you have any questions for me, now that we’re done? Thanks, that was very helpful!</p>
        </div>
        <section>
            <h2 class="final">Summary of Findings</h2>
                <div class="results">
                    <p>The usability test was conducted in-person, over a recorded span of 2 minutes (excluding briefing). Overall, all tasks were done very efficiently, as user was understandably very familiar with the platform, having spent a lot of time daily engaging with it, and spend no time scanning or thinking through the entire screen for icons. User appeared relaxed and confident throughout the testing session, which is helpful as he was also comfortable in speaking out loud about his thought processes.</p>
                    <p>To statistically benchmark the usefulness of the platform's interface for the specific tasks, we will look at 3 key parameters, which are very closely linked to one another: (1) <span class="green">Efficiency,</span> (2) <span class="green">Error</span>, and (3) <span class="green">Satisfaction</span>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="results">
                    <h3>Task 1: Upload a photo</h3>
                    <p>Among the three tasks, <span class="green">Task 1</span> has the least usable interface, as user performed this with error during the first step (however, user did not realise the error, as this was a paper prototype, and simply assumed to move on to the next screen). Putting the error aside, in terms of efficiency, user seems to have performed the task with utmost efficiency (spending very little amount of time and number of clicks to fulfil a task). Similarly, this efficiency leads to a satisfactory user feedback at the end of the task. Nevertheless, had the user been tested on a working app prototype, the task would not have been able to be completed efficiently and user will not have been satisfied, as the initial error would have made the user spend more time on clicking to return to the home screen, as well as to search for the icon that leads him to the second screen.</p>
                    <p>To rectify this, we would propose to conduct more tests to increase the sample size, and determine if this is a common recurring error among all users. At the same time, we will also examine the hypothesis that most Instagram users do not use the in-app camera feature as a primary camera tool, and uses their OS camera for that purpose instead. If both propositions are true, or if only the second hypothesis is true, we will propose to adjust the upper-left camera icon to a less prominent position on the screen, or even gradually limit the functionality of the feature. If only the first hypothesis is true, we will only adjust the positioning of the icon, as users can still use the camera feature from the second screen (by selecting 'Photo').</p>
                    <p>As an additional note, user commented during the caption crafting step that he would typically close the app and searches for relevant, trending hashtags on Google. This is potentially a feature that many other users would also find useful.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="results">
                    <h3>Task 2: Comment on a photo</h3>
                    <p>This task is relatively simpler than the other two, and user successfully completed the task with the least number of clicks possible, and with no error.</p>
                </div>   
                <div class="results">
                    <h3>Task 3: Create an Instagram story</h3>
                    <p>The user also performed this task successfully, making good use of the camera panning and additional features such as GIF stickers.</p>

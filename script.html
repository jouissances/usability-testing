            <p>"Hi. My name is Janice, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that we’re working on so we can see whether it works as intended.
            The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. There is no right or wrong answer.</p>
            <p>As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us. Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know. </p>
            <p>OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions. First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day? Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether would you say you spend browsing the Internet?</p>
            <p>What kinds of sites are you looking at when you browse the Web? Do you have any favorite websites?" </p>

                        <li>Out of the 4 hours, spends about 15-20 minutes on e-mails and the rest of the time browsing</li>
                        <li>Favourite website: Reddit</li>

                <p>OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things. </p>
            <p>Now I’m going to ask you to try doing some specific tasks. I’m going to read each one out loud and give you a printed copy. And again, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try to think out loud as you go along.</p>
            <p>Alright. Do you have any questions for me, now that we’re done? Thanks, that was very helpful!</p>

            <h2>Observations</h2>
                <div class="results">
                    <h3>Upload a photo</h3>
                        <p><span>First screen</span>: User clicked on the Camera icon at the upper-left corner, then expected to reach the second screen, which is not the case — the Camera icon leads to a real-time camera feature, where users capture an image via the Instagram app and posts that image. To access the Photo Album as shown in the second screen, the user needed to click on the Plus icon at the bottom-center of the screen.</p>
                        <p><span>Second screen</span>: Afterwards, the user chose a photo by clicking on one of the small squares within the lower half of the screen. However, user didn’t click Next — he expected to reach the third screen right away.</p>
                        <p><span>Third screen</span>: User didn’t use the in-app filter features, as they are ‘for peasants’. User clicked Next.</p>
                        <p><span>Fourth screen</span>: User clicked on the caption section, and typed in some caption (“Me and my girlfriend, hashtag”). User commented that he would mostly post fitness pictures, and would leave the app to do a Google search on the current top fitness hashtags, copy them, then come back to the app and paste them in. User doesn’t usually use the tag or location feature. If user thinks that the pictures are good enough, he will opt to share the photo on Facebook. Not Twitter or Tumblr, as user does not have active accounts.</p>
                        <p><span>Fifth screen</span>: Task is done.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="results">
                    <h3>Comment on a photo</h3>
                        <p><span>First screen</span>: User clicked on the Speech Bubble icon under the Instagram picture post. There is another alternative way to add comment, via the ‘Add a comment…’ section, however, user chose the first method.</p>
                        <p><span>Second screen</span>: User types his comment (“Yoooooo”). User expected to click an Enter key on the keyboard to post, however, finds none, and finally clicked on the Post section after a couple of tries. Task is done.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="results">
                    <h3>Create an Instagram story</h3>
                        <p><span>First screen</span>: User clicked on the You icon.</p>
                        <p><span>Second screen</span>: User clicked and held on the bottom-center round button while panning the paper. User clicked the right arrow at the upper-right corner.</p>
                        <p><span>Third screen</span>: User added a gif sticker (“Dancing Shaq”) and clicks the Your Story icon at the bottom-left corner. Task is done.</p>
                        <p><span>Fourth screen</span>: Does not apply to user, as this screen only appears when user clicks on the Send To icon at the bottom-right corner.</p>
